    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought us on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Our goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such skewed distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, we implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\\\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\\\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model: _Random Forest_\n",
    "- Random Forest Classifier can be used in finance, to detect fraudsters trying to scam the bank. It is also used to detect customers more likely to repay their debt on time, or use a bank's services more frequently. [Source](https://builtin.com/data-science/random-forest-algorithm)\n",
    "- Strengths: it works well with both categorical and continuous data, and can handle missing data and outliers. It is comparatively less impacted by noise. [Source](http://theprofessionalspoint.blogspot.com/2019/02/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-random.html#:~:text=Random%20Forest%20is%20usually%20robust,to%20impact%20all%20the%20trees.)\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Random Forest creates a lot of trees (unlike only one tree in case of decision tree) and combines their outputs. Hence, it requires much more computational power and resources. Also, Random Forest require much more time to train as compared to decision trees as it generates a lot of trees. [Source](http://theprofessionalspoint.blogspot.com/2019/02/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-random.html#:~:text=Random%20Forest%20is%20usually%20robust,to%20impact%20all%20the%20trees.)\n",
    "- Random Forest helps to improve overfitting and works well when the data has a lot of categorical variables, like this dataset. It is a high performing model since it combines many weak learners to make a strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model: _AdaBoost_\n",
    "- AdaBoost can be used to solve a variety of real-world problems, such as predicting customer churn(percentage of customers that stopped using a company's product or service during a certain time frame) and classifying the types of topics customers are talking/calling about. It can also be used for face detection in images. [Source](https://hackernoon.com/under-the-hood-of-adaboost-8eb499d78eab)\n",
    "- Strengths: It is fast, simple and easy to program. It is resistant to overfitting and performs very well in practice. [Source](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~nikolaon/~nikolaon_files/Introduction_to_AdaBoost.pdf)\n",
    "- Weaknesses: It is sensitive to noisy data & outliers, as it takes the weighted errors and outliers can affect its performance.  Moreover, it does not work well with skewed data. [Source](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~nikolaon/~nikolaon_files/Introduction_to_AdaBoost.pdf)\n",
    "- Adaboost is an efficient boosting technique that improves according to the errors in the previous model. Considering that the skewed data has been handled, its speed and ease of use make it a good model for the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model: _Gradient Boosting_\n",
    "- Strengths: It usually provides high accuracy, and lot of flexibility as there are many hyperparameters that can be tuned. It works well with categorical and numerical data. [Source](http://uc-r.github.io/gbm_regression#proscons)\n",
    "- Weaknesses: They often require a lot of trees which can be time and memory exhaustive. The high flexibility results in many parameters that interact and influence heavily the behavior of the approach (number of iterations, tree depth, regularization parameters, etc.). This requires a large grid search during tuning. [Source](http://uc-r.github.io/gbm_regression#proscons)\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting uses many weak learners (trees) and optimises the model based on the residuals. It also works well with both categorical and numerical data and hence, would be a good model for our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Reasons for not considering the other models:_\n",
    "- Decision Tree: Tends to overfit. A better alternative would be to use Random Forest where multiple decision trees (weak learners) are used to make a strong learning model.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: Generally used when there is no high correlation between predictors, which might not be the case here since features like age, education_num, marital-status would be highly correlated.\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent: Only works well with a linear model, which may or may not be the case here.\n",
    "- Naive Bayes: The features may not be independent to each other, which is a necessity in Naive Bayes. Example: age determines education and marital status.\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors: It is best for a small dataset, and classification depends on the similarity of earlier data points. This might not be the case for our dataset.\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines: This model was briefly considered by me, but since it is very time consuming, I chose to proceed with the other models."

    "_Gradient Boosting_ seems to be the best model among the three. Even though it has the highest training time, training is only a one-time process, or an infrequent one. It also has significantly low testing time (less than 0.1 seconds). Moreover, it gives more accuracy than AdaBoost Classifier in training set. The F-score for Gradient Boosting Classifier is higher than that of the other classifiers for both training and testing set. It does not seem to overfit or underfit."

    "_Gradient Boosting_ is an ensemble learning model based on boosting. It initially takes a random sample from the original data to form a model (tree). Then it calculates the gradients, or _residuals_ (`Observed values - Actual values`) to form another model. It keeps repeating this process until there are no residuals left, or the residual values tend to zero.\n",
    "The final model is the _sum_ of all the models formed in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a method based on using weak learners and helping them learn from the previous model to improve further. Gradient Boosting gives high accuracy and F-score, and the testing time is quite low. Hence, this makes a good model in a lot of cases and has many hyperparameters that can be tuned to further increase the scores."

    "Capital loss and capital gain are significant in the prediction, which does seem reasonable and should have been considered by me. Moreover, I predicted education level to be an important feature, but number of years of education seems right too since the more number of years of education someone completes, the more likely they would be to earn >50K. I am not sure about why being married is an important feature here for prediction, but my guess would be that it is closely related to age(an older person will more likely be married), which is an important feature in determining the income (as discussed above).\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. We now use the same optimized model found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
